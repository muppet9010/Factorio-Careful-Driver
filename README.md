Mod Compatibility
-----------------

- This mod doesn't change any of the collision masks of default entity types. So it should have no impact on other mods.


Future Ideas
------------

- Add graphic versions with the vehicles partially under water. Initial trails around this worked for vehicles fully in the water, but those half on land and half off looked odd. So at present these aren't included.
