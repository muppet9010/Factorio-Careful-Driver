To Add:
    - A way for players to appear to stay in the water vehicle for a few seconds until the effect finishes, then get ejected out. Will need to be done in a way that doesn't confuse other mods in to thinking the player died. Maybe we just leave the player in the vehicle (allow players in a stuck vehicle) as its got a collision box, etc. Only issue is if the player is too far from land to get out themselves?
