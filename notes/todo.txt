Bugs:
	- Zoom in on car stuck in water when updating GIF to add any car features/changes. So that the modified graphic is more obvious, probably need a more straight east car orientation as well.


To Add:
    - Players can walk in to the water or void and treated similar to how vehicles are currently. Also player walking in to water would tie in to a player getting out of a car stuck in the water.
    - Players (& cars ?) can fall down cliffs going high to low side of the cliff. Does a percentage of max health damage, ignoring shields. Also stuns the player.
