Bugs:


To Add:
    - Players can walk in to the water or void and treated similar to how vehicles are currently. Also player walking in to water would tie in to a player getting out of a car stuck in the water.
    - Players can fall down cliffs going high to low side of the cliff. Does a percentage of max health damage, ignoring shields. Also stuns the player. Ideally move the player down the cliff over a bit, but need to make sure the player doesn't teleport away during it and also that they can't walk against the teleport.


Future Notes/Thoughts:
	- Zoom in on car stuck in water when updating GIF to add any car features/changes. So that the modified graphic is more obvious, probably need a more straight east car orientation as well.
    - Should the car be able to fall down cliffs as well. If so need to handle if it tries to move during the process.
