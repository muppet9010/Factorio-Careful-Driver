Mod Compatibility
-----------------

- This mod doesn't change any of the collision masks of default entity types. So it should have no impact on other mods.


Future Ideas
------------

- The graphics used for when road vehicles end up in the water have to be specifically made. I am no artist so they are a bit crude and the entire vehicle has an alternative graphic, despite sometimes only part of the vehicle being in the water. Where these haven't been made for modded vehicles the regular vehicle graphic will be used instead. These graphics are just to help signify the vehicle isn't normal any more.
